# Feature Requirement Document Generation Rule

## When to Apply This Rule:

This rule applies when the user requests implementation of a **new feature** or **new functionality**. Apply this rule when you detect:

- Requests to implement, add, create, or build new features
- Requests for new functionality that doesn't exist yet
- Feature requests that require planning and documentation
- Request to update a document in `docs/features/`

**Do NOT apply this rule for:**

- Bug fixes or debugging
- Code reviews or explanations
- Modifications to existing features (unless explicitly a new feature)
- Questions or documentation requests

## When a new feature implementation is requested:

1. **ALWAYS generate a Feature Requirement Document (FRED) FIRST** before starting any implementation work.

2. **FRED Generation Process**:

   - Generate a comprehensive document covering all template sections:
   - Feature Name: Short, descriptive title for the feature.
   - Goal: What problem does this feature solve? Why does it exist?
   - User Story: As a [user type], I want to [goal], so that I can [benefit].
   - Functional Requirements: List core behaviors the feature must support. Be specific and measurable.
   - Data Requirements (optional): What new tables, fields, or relationships are needed? What existing data do we reuse?
   - User Flow: Step-by-step actions the user performs from start to finish.
   - Acceptance Criteria: Clear conditions defining when this feature is “done”.
   - Edge Cases: List tricky scenarios the system must handle.
   - Non-Functional Requirements (Optional): Performance, security, UX constraints

3. **File Naming**:

   - Save the FRED in `docs/features/` directory
   - Use kebab-case for the filename based on the feature name
   - Example: "User Authentication" → `user-authentication.md`
   - Example: "Campaign Generation" → `campaign-generation.md`

4. **FRED Content Requirements**:

   - Be specific and detailed in all sections
   - Functional Requirements should be measurable and testable
   - User Flow should include step-by-step actions
   - Acceptance Criteria must be clear and verifiable
   - Consider edge cases and error scenarios
   - Include data requirements if the feature involves database changes

5. **After FRED Generation**:

   - Present the FRED to the user for review
   - Wait for confirmation or feedback before proceeding with implementation
   - Only start implementation after the FRED is approved or finalized

6. **Exception**: If the user explicitly states "skip FRED" or "implement directly", you may proceed without generating the document, but this should be rare.

## Example Trigger Phrases (Apply Rule):

- "Implement [feature name]"
- "Add [feature name]"
- "Create [feature name]"
- "Build [feature name]"
- "I need [feature name]"
- "We need a new [feature]"
- "Let's add [feature]"
- Any request that implies creating **new** functionality that doesn't currently exist

## Example Non-Trigger Phrases (Do NOT Apply Rule):

- "Fix [bug]"
- "Debug [issue]"
- "Update [existing feature]"
- "Modify [existing code]"
- "How does [feature] work?"
- "Explain [code]"
- Requests about existing functionality

## Example Workflow:

User: "Implement user authentication"
Agent:

1. Generates `docs/features/user-authentication.md` following the template
2. Presents the FRED for review
3. After approval, proceeds with implementation
