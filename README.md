## Grimpo Lite

A **visual prototype**: a deep-sea canvas where you can map a project at **Strategic (big picture)** and **Tactical (execution)** levels, plus **Resource (research)** nodes. Everything saves to **localStorage** (no backend).

### Why you built it
I want to solve my anxiety of not getting anything done. I also want to visualise my research, strategy, and execution. Basically the whole project life cycle in one platform.
### What works today
The main features: the garden(rewarding system), cards&nodes, mascot assistants, the app logo, roles/spawing (ai visual planning templates)
### What would you add with more time?
An ai assistant chatbot to help me research, parse the document, generate tasks, summarise docs, create a task summary.
### What works today
## Getting Started

actually use pnpm 

Install and run:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open `http://localhost:3000`.

## Quick demo script (60 seconds)

- Pan/zoom the abyss canvas.
- Click the **+** FAB to add Strategy/Tactical/Resource nodes.
- Connect nodes with glowing edges.
- Toggle **Auto / Strategy / Tactical** (top-right).
- Mark Tactical nodes **Done**; click **Swallow** to delete.
- Refresh the page: your map persists.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
